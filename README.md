This is a library exclusivly for Amazon Mechanical Turk. This library 
implements two algorithms which are tree-like and bubble-like respectively.

Sometimes, MTurk requesters have a big task which needs to be divided into
small sub-tasks and combines their sub-results to reach the final answer.
This process can be organized like a tree or a bubble.

With this library, you can easily achieve the goal just. By implementing
an interface, passing the parameters which serves your personal purpose to
an instance of the algorithm and run this instance, everything will be done.
